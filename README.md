# OGX-Mini 2026
![OGX-Mini Boards](images/OGX-Mini-github.jpg "OGX-Mini Boards")

Firmware for the RP2040, capable of emulating gamepads for several game consoles. The firmware comes in many flavors, supported on the [Adafruit Feather USB Host board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5723), Pi Pico, Pi Pico 2, Pi Pico W, Pi Pico 2 W, Waveshare RP2040-Zero, Pico/ESP32 hybrid, and a 4-Channel RP2040-Zero setup.

[**Visit the web app here**](https://wiredopposite.github.io/OGX-Mini-WebApp/) to change your mappings and deadzone settings. To pair the OGX-Mini with the web app via USB, plug your controller in, then connect it to your PC, hold **Start + Left Bumper + Right Bumper** to enter web app mode. Click "Connect via USB" in the web app and select the OGX-Mini. You can also pair via Bluetooth, no extra steps are needed in that case. 

## Supported platforms
- Original Xbox
- Playstation 3
- Nintendo Switch 1 & 2 (docked)
- XInput (UsbdSecPatch no longer required, works without it)
- Playstation Classic
- DInput
- Wii U (GameCube Adapter)

## Changing platforms
By default the OGX-Mini will emulate an OG Xbox controller, you must hold a button combo for 3 seconds to change which platform you want to play on. Your chosen mode will persist after powering off the device. 

Start = Plus (Switch) = Options (Dualsense/DS4)

- XInput
    - Start + Dpad Up 
- Original Xbox
    - Start + Dpad Right
- Original Xbox Steel Battalion
    - Start + Dpad Right + Right Bumper
- Original Xbox DVD Remote
    - Start + Dpad Right + Left Bumper
- Switch
    - Start + Dpad Down
- PlayStation 3
    - Start + Dpad Left
- PlayStation Classic
    - Start + A (Cross for PlayStation and B for Switch gamepads)
- Wii U (GameCube Adapter)
      - Start + Left Bumper + D-Pad Down
- Web Application Mode
    - Start + Left Bumper + Right Bumper


After a new mode is stored, the RP2040 will reset itself so you don't need to unplug it.

## Disconnecting Controllers
For most controllers pressing and holding Start+Select (+/-, etc) for the controller will disconnect it and restart pairing mode.
For the OUYA controller there is no Start+Select, the disconnection combo has been set to L3+R3.

# Features new to this fork:
Note: These features have been added to the Pico W/ Pico 2 W firmware support, I do not have the other boards to test and implement the same fixes at this time.
- Ability to emulate the GameCube controller adapter for Wii U. (Also tested on Switch 1/ 2)
- Wii U & Switch Pro controllers are supported fully with working LT and RT
- Wii Remotes are supported along with the following controllers connected: Nunchuck/ GameCube/ Wii Gamepad.
- Disconnection Combo has been added: Start+Select for most controllers, L3+R3 for OUYA controllers.

## Features new to v1.0.0

- Web application (connectable via USB or Bluetooth) for configuring deadzones and buttons mappings, supports up to 8 saved profiles.
- Pi Pico 2 and Pico 2 W (RP2350) support.
- Reduced latency by about 3-4 ms, graphs showing comparisons are coming.

## Hardware
For Pi Pico, RP2040-Zero, 4 channel, and ESP32 configurations, please see the hardware folder for diagrams.

I've designed a PCB for the RP2040-Zero so you can make a small form-factor adapter yourself. The gerber files, schematic, and BOM are in Hardware folder.

If you would like a prebuilt unit, you can purchase one, with cable and Xbox adapter included, from the original creators store: [**Etsy store**](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1426992904/ogx-mini-controller-adapter-for-original).

## Adding supported controllers
If your third party controller isn't working, but the original version is listed above, send me the device's VID and PID and I'll add it so it's recognized properly.

## Build
### RP2040
You can compile this for different boards with the CMake argument ```OGXM_BOARD``` while configuring the project. 

The options are:
- ```PI_PICO``` 
- ```PI_PICO2``` 
- ```PI_PICOW``` 
- ```PI_PICO2W``` 
- ```RP2040_ZERO``` 
- ```ADAFRUIT_FEATHER``` 
- ```ESP32_BLUEPAD32_I2C```
- ```ESP32_BLUERETRO_I2C``` 
- ```EXTERNAL_4CH_I2C```

You can also set ```MAX_GAMEPADS``` which, if greater than one, will only support DInput (PS3) and Switch.

You'll need git, python3, CMake, Ninja and the GCC ARM toolchain installed. CMake scripts will patch some files in Bluepad32 and BTStack and also make sure all git submodules (plus their submodules and dependencies) are downloaded. Here's an example on Windows:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MegaCadeDev/OGX-Mini-2026.git
cd OGX-Mini-2026/Firmware/RP2040
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOGXM_BOARD=PI_PICOW -DMAX_GAMEPADS=1
cmake --build build
```
Or just install the GCC ARM toolchain and use the CMake Tools extension in VSCode.

### ESP32
Please see the Hardware directory for a diagram showing how to hookup the ESP32 to your RP2040.

You will need ESP-IDF v5.1, esptool, python3, and git installed. If you use VSCode, you can install the ESP-IDF extension and configure the project for ESP-IDF v5.1, it'll download everything for you and then you just click the build button at the bottom of the window.

When you build with ESP-IDF, Cmake will run a python script that copies the necessary BTStack files into the components directory, this is needed since BTStack isn't configured as an ESP-IDF component when you download it with git.
